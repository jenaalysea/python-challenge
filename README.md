Tutoring session with Limei Hou --
    Discussed how to successfully import the CSV file and set up the terminal to show the results from the code
    She demonstrated a for loop and the logic of how it could be used to iterate through the data to answer questions, and how to know when to define a value or create a list for the coding to either have a referred value, or a place to store values as they are created in the loop


Ask BCS Learning Assistant:
1 - Liang Lyam (November 4, 2023) - he demonstrated how I did not need to set a string value -- and was getting python confused with VBA language
2 - Robert (November 5, 2023) - he walked me through how I was not defining some of my lists with proper values, or when I should leave the list open
3 - Zayna - (November 5, 2023) - Zayna recommended I consider creating a dictionary to store my keys / values and referenced a site to gain better assistance (referenced below)
4 - Courtney - (November 5, 2023) - Courtney made recommendations for me to consider how I was referencing the total and percentage vote count for the PyPoll assignment, and instead of creating a new for loop, to use the loop already established
5 - Jonathan - (November 6, 2023) - Jonathan reviewed the code I had created and showed me on one line how I could re-think determining the winning candidate value by creating a new for loop that would iterate through the list I had created to look for the > value and set the greater number as the new value.
6 - Luna - (November 6, 2023) - Luna helped me identify how a part of my indentation was wrong and how I needed to move one of my values that equals 0 to reflect before the for loop, otherwise my code was re-setting back to 0 during the wrong stage of the counts and creating incorrect answers.
